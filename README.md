# Ergotera's infrared remote Android App
Android application for the Ergotera's infrared remote. The application allows users to create virtual buttons and regroup them in virtual remotes. The virtual buttons have a name, a sound or a command and an image. The virtual remotes have a name and a list of buttons. The user can then select a remote to enter the 'action mode', where the remote can be controller by external buttons connected to the Ergotera's infrared remote.

## Naming and Conventions
1. All code, comments and logs in english;
2. Files should include proper Ergotera's headers or information about the origin of the code if it came from an external source;
3. View component names start by the name of the fragment or activity they are in, followed by what it is;
4. Every log of the application should use our custom logger class Logger.
